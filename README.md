# SpotifyFrontend

Built for the 2019 Facebook hackathon. Allows you to crowdsource a collaborative spotify playlist by setting a threshold of likes each song must recieve. If a song passes the set amount of likes, it gets added to the playlist. This prevents the case where one member floods a collaborative playlist with music only they like. The front-end is integrated with the spotify api and utilises a server side event source to recieve song likes in real time.
